# ReactApp
This is a book management application which is developed by React.js. Regarding the server API, I used the json-server, which is a solution of front-back stage decoupling, to simulate a rest API and used fetch method to connect with it. Besides, this project is based on the ECMAScript 6, so that npm has been utilized to build developing environment like installing json-server, react, react-router, roadhog and ANT design.
