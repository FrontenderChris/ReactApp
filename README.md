# ReactApp
This is a book CRUD application which is developed by React.js. Regarding the server API, I used the json-server, which is a solution of front-back stage decoupling, to simulate a rest API and used fetch method to connect with it. Besides, this project is based on the ECMAScript 6, so that npm has been utilized to build developing environment like installing json-server, react, react-router, roadhog and ANT design.

Once cloning this project, you can:
1. npm i roadhog json-server -g    // To install the global tolls
2. npm i                           // Install the tools based on this project
3. npm run server                  // To run the server API which based on json-server
4. npm run dev                     // To run the project *this stage should do on another new cmd window
